# Lottery Syndicate (Random Numbers Generator)

<!--- Website overview -->
Lottery Syndicate (Random Numbers Generator) is a game to allow the player to generate random lottery numbers. Many companies, organisations, families and friends have their own lottery syndicates set-up. This game allows those syndicates to create their own set of random numbers. There are three games available: Euromillions, Lotto and Dailymillions. The user selects the game they want to play and whether they want plus included. They then enter the number of lines required and the number of members in the syndicate. Once the generate button is activated, the random numbers are displayed on screen along with the costs involved.
